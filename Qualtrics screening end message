We would like to thank you for your interest but you are unfortunately not eligible for this study because your current video game playing habits are inconsistent with your Prolific prescreening responses and do not match our recruitment criteria. Please note that this is in no way a judgement over those habits, simply a recruitement factor for the study to have meaningful results.

In addition, we recommend you update your profile on Prolific so that such situations does not happen to you in the future.

Please note we cannot change this criteria and we kindly ask you to return your submission on Prolific by selecting the 'stop without completing' button.'

Finally, do not reuse the provided link to submit different answers to the prescreening questions. We verify all data. In such cases, no payment will be issued, as the data becomes invalid.
